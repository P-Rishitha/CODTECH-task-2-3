## **Image Classification with CNN Using TensorFlow**

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification, built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained and evaluated on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.

### **Overview**

The code demonstrates:
1. Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Building a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
3. Training the model for image classification.
4. Evaluating the model's performance on a test set.

---

### **Steps in the Code**

1. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - The **CIFAR-10 dataset** is loaded using TensorFlow's `cifar10.load_data()`.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - Data is normalized by scaling pixel values to the range [0, 1] for faster convergence during training.

2. **Building the CNN Model**  
   The CNN is designed to classify images into 10 classes and includes:
   - **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from the images using 32 and 64 filters.
   - **MaxPooling Layers:** Reduce spatial dimensions, decreasing computation and preventing overfitting.
   - **Flatten Layer:** Convert 2D feature maps into 1D feature vectors.
   - **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers for final classification, with:
     - 64 neurons in the hidden layer.
     - 10 neurons in the output layer (one for each class) with a softmax activation function.

3. **Compiling and Training**  
   - **Loss Function:** `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` for multi-class classification.
   - **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rates.
   - **Metrics:** Accuracy to monitor training progress.
   - The model is trained for **10 epochs** with validation on the test data.

4. **Evaluation**  
   During training, the model evaluates its performance on the test set after each epoch. The validation accuracy and loss provide insights into how well the model generalizes.

### **Dataset**

The **CIFAR-10 dataset** is a widely used dataset for image classification, containing 60,000 color images (32x32) across 10 classes:
- Classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.
- Training set: 50,000 images.
- Test set: 10,000 images.

---

### **Results**

The model achieves around **65%-70% accuracy** on the test set after 10 epochs. The performance can be improved by:
- Adding more convolutional and dense layers.
- Using data augmentation techniques.
- Increasing the number of epochs or performing hyperparameter tuning.

---

### **Extensions**

You can enhance the project by:
- Implementing dropout to prevent overfitting.
- Adding data augmentation for improved generalization.
- Using pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG for better accuracy.
